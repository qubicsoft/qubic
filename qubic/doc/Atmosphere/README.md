Atmosphere by Victor Chabirand 2024-09-07

- An absorption_coefficient folder. This comes from the am model of the atmosphere. 

- The Atmosphere_Qubic Jupyter notebook, which contains all the computations of correlations based on the model of Josquin, but with Qubicâ€™s beam. Note that I have only worked with monochromatic sources, it is not clear for me how to integrate the absorption_coefficient for a polychromatic source. See the function absorption_coeff_integrated.
