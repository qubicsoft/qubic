## Documentation on how QUBIC works and some improvements in end-to-end simulation pipeline:

.. scan.pdf: Notes with detailed explanations of the methods and configurations used in the pipeline (by Thibaut Louise)

### Notebooks for beginners qubicsoft users.
.. beamtest.Rmd: 
	This code plots the beam profiles for the 3 possible values of the dictionary entry 'beam_shape' at 150 and 220 GHz

.. monofreq_pipeline_end2end.Rmd:
	This notebook is the typical pipeline for data simulation and analysis. There are 2 parts : a) From a given sky map, simulate Time Order Data (TOD); b)	From those TOD, perform Map Making to reconstruct the input sky. Here we work with only one frequency band.

.. SynthesizedBeam.Rmd: 
	This notebook aims at showing how to obtain the QUBIC Synthesized beam for a given set of horns accounting for various effects (detector size, bandwidth...).
