Because the input map $T$ is at the angular resolution of the instrument, each column of the pointing matrix contains only zeros and a single 1 that tell which was the pixel seen by the corresponding time sample. This simplification is important is not valid for QUBIC, which explains why we had to developp a specific map-making.\n",
