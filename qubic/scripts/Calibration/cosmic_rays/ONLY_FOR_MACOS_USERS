For users intending to run the script in a Python environment installed on the MacOS operating system,
I recommend comparing the results obtained (in terms of time constants) with those present in the
'crd_results.zip' archive.

While running the script on different operating systems, I observed that the
scipy.interpolate.LSQUnivariateSpline function (used for atmospheric drift removal)
returns the same values for the signal cleaned from drift on Linux/Windows, whereas on MacOS,
these values differ from the former by a maximum error on the order of 10^-9.

This could lead to a slight deviation in the time constant values obtained on MacOS
compared to those obtained on Linux/Windows
