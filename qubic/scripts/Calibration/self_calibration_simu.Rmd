# Simulations for self-calibration (fringes)

#### Edited by Louise
I have implemented a class in selfcal_lib.py which allowed to do several simulations concerning the calibration. This notebook gives some examples of what you can do with.


One remark : I tried to put documentation for each function. On a jupyter notebook, if you want to have acces just press shift+tab when your cursor is on the name of the function. 

```{python}
% matplotlib inline
% matplotlib notebook

import glob
import healpy as hp
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
import pandas as pd
import cv2

from qubicpack import qubicpack as qp
from qubicpack import pix2tes
from qubicpack.utilities import ASIC_index

import qubic

import selfcal_lib
```

```{python}
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8, 8)
```

## Make a dictionary 
useful for the qubicsoft

```{python}
basedir = '/home/louisemousset/QUBIC/MyGitQUBIC'
dictfilename = basedir + '/qubic/qubic/scripts/global_source.dict'

d = qubic.qubicdict.qubicDict()
d.read_from_file(dictfilename)
```

## Create an object 

```{python}
ca = selfcal_lib.SelfCalibration([12, 28], [], d)
```

Look at method that are in this class :

```{python}
dir(ca)
```

## Get all combinations for one baseline
This is a simulation that doesn't take into account optical aberrations.

```{python}
# You need a qubic instrument for that function
q = qubic.QubicInstrument(d)

S, Cminus_i, Cminus_j, Sminus_ij, Ci, Cj, Sij = ca.get_power_combinations(q, theta=[0., 0.2], phi=[[0., 0.2]])
```

```{python}
S.shape
```

## I want an instrument in a specific horn config

```{python}
q.horn.open[3]=True
q.horn
```

```{python}
power = ca.get_power_on_array(q)
power.shape
```

```{python}
imshow(power[:,:,0])
```

## Directly the fringes for each TES

```{python}
tes_fringes_signal = ca.get_fringes_fp_TD()
tes_fringes_signal.shape

```

```{python}
# There are 8 thermometers that are set to 0. and 248 TES
tes_fringes_signal
```

### The focal plane image associated

```{python}
img = ca.tes_signal2image_fp(tes_fringes_signal[:,0])
imshow(img)
```

## The power in the focal plane with optical aberrations
Using Creidhe simulations (need to download the files)

```{python}
# Path to the simulated files 
rep = '/home/louisemousset/QUBIC/Qubic_work/Calibration/RF_switch/simu_creidhe_aberrations/'

int, int_fp = ca.get_power_fp_aberration(rep)
```

```{python}
# If you want a specific configuration (all open for example)
int_open, int_fp_open = ca.get_power_fp_aberration(rep, indep_config=np.arange(1, 65, 1))
```

```{python}
int_fp.shape
```

### I want only a quarter of the focal plane

```{python}
int_quarter_fp = ca.full2quarter(int_fp)
imshow(int_quarter_fp)
```

### I want the signal for each TES with the real indices 

```{python}
signal = ca.image_fp2tes_signal(int_quarter_fp)
signal.shape
```

## Beam on the sky

```{python}
# For the function, you need a instrument and a scene
q = qubic.QubicInstrument(d)
s = qubic.QubicScene(d)

sb = ca.get_synthetic_beam_sky(q, s, 34, default_open=True)
```

```{python}
# The synthetic beam optained has a value for each pixel on the sky. You should use Healpy if you want to plot it.
sb.shape
```

```{python}

```
