        "\n",
        "Below we perform the TOD creation and recnstruction in a single call. When setting the noise to zero, and simulating data (TOD creation) in a consistent manner with the reconstruction model, we see zero bias for the three instrument configurations (Imager, BI and BI-GPA): they all lead to $\\sim 10^{-15}$ residuals, consistent with numerical noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### TOD fabrication realism:\n",
        "An important parameter is the `TOD_method` one, it realtes to how realistically we construct our TODs. It can take the follwing values:\n",
        "- `exact`: The instrument sees the sky throuugh the synthesized beam, therefore an exact TOD can be calculated in the following manner: we first convolve the sky with the full shape of the synthesized beam (be it modeled as an imager, a BI or a BI-GPA), then convolve it with the reconstructed pixels window function and then pick values at the pointing locations to form the TODs. The issue with this technique is that is is \"too realistic\" with respect to our reconstruction procedure that is based on modeling the sky through H which goes from TOD to a pixellized sky. In 2D, with Healpix maps, we usually form the simulated TODs from a map that is pixellized at the same size as the reconstructed map, so this effect is absorbed. With real data, this is what the instrument does, so this mismatch, although probably very small, should be there.\n",
        "- `approx`: here we solve the above issue by constructing the TODs in the same fashion as with H, but \"by hand\": we first convolve the input sky with the angular resolution (not the multi-peaked synthesized beam) and the reconstructed pixels window function, we then pixellize this to the reconstructed pixellization (using interpolation). We then get the pixel numbers for each peack and build the TOD by summing those multiplied by the amplitude of each peak. This is what one usually does with 2D simulations.\n",
        "- `approx_Hd`: we directly do the same as for `approx` but simply applying H to the resolution + reconstructed pixels window function convolved sky. It should be strictly equivalent (within numerical errors) to `approx`.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, in this notebook, I suggest to stay with `approx` and investigate the effects of TOD fabrication realism in another notebook. In brief, in the `exact` case, the pointing will pick a number of pointing locations falling into a given reconstruction pixel (or a collection of reconstructed pixels in the case of B.I.), the reconstructed pixel value will be a combination of those picked values. This is exactly what an actual instrument does. However, when comparing with the expected truth, which is estimated independently of the poinitng, we assume a value for the reconstructed pixel which is the mathematical average of all picked values in the pixel. But for a finite number of pointings, the empirical average (obtained when reconstructing with inverting the H equation) will never reach the mathematical average and will always fluctuate around it. This results in a kind of \"poinitng sample variance\". The efect is large for a low number of pointings but will gradually vanish for a large number of pointings. In realistic observation cases, it is very likely to be absolutely negligible (becasue of the large number of pointings and even further due to the measurement noise that will largely dominate in general). As a result it appears as a good approximmation to use instead the `approx` method for building TODs, as it will lead to a TOD for which reconstruction will lead to the mathematical average and therefore zero residuals. \n",
        "\n",
        "##### Remarks: \n",
        "- this TOD realism issue applies to an imager in the same fasion as for a BI.\n",
        "- When using the `approx` method, it is impossible to account for the ripples in the B.I. synthesized beam by construction. As a result, the effect of these ripples cannot be assessed, this can only be done using the `exact` method and will therefore be mixed with the TOD-realism related effects.\n",
